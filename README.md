# Apache HTTP Server Cloud Native Buildpack

The HTTPD CNB provides the [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org) binary distribution.
The buildpack installs the HTTPD binary distribution onto the `$PATH` which makes it available for
subsequent buildpacks, and sets up the start command which signals httpd to start.

A usage example can be found in the
[`samples` repository under the `httpd` directory](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/samples/tree/main/httpd).

#### The HTTPD buildpack is compatible with the following builder(s):
- [Paketo Full Builder](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/full-builder)

## Integration

The Apache HTTPD CNB provides httpd as a dependency. Downstream buildpacks, like
[php-web](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/php-web) can require the httpd
dependency by generating a [Build Plan
TOML](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/master/buildpack.md#build-plan-toml)
file that looks like the following:

```toml
[[requires]]

  # The name of the Apache HTTPD dependency is "httpd". This value is considered
  # part of the public API for the buildpack and will not change without a plan
  # for deprecation.
  name = "httpd"

  # The version of the Apache HTTPD dependency is not required. In the case it
  # is not specified, the buildpack will provide the newest version, which can
  # be seen in the buildpack.toml file.
  # If you wish to request a specific version, the buildpack supports
  # specifying a semver constraint in the form of "2.*", "2.4.*", or even
  # "2.4.43".
  version = "2.4.43"

  # The Apache HTTPD buildpack supports some non-required metadata options.
  [requires.metadata]

    # Setting the launch flag to true will ensure that the Apache HTTPD
    # dependency is available on the $PATH for the running application. If you
    # are writing an application that needs to run Apache HTTPD at runtime, this
    # flag should be set to true.
    launch = true
```

## Usage

To package this buildpack for consumption:

```
$ ./scripts/package.sh -v <version>
```

## Configurations

Specifying the HTTP Server version through `buildpack.yml` configuration
will be deprecated in Apache HTTP Server Buildpack v1.0.0.

To migrate from using `buildpack.yml` please set the following environment
variables at build time either directly (ex. `pack build my-app --env
BP_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=some-value`) or through a [`project.toml`
file](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/extensions/project-descriptor.md)

### `BP_ROADRUNNER_VERSION`
The `BP_ROADRUNNER_VERSION` variable allows you to specify the version of RoadRunner Server that is installed.

```shell
BP_ROADRUNNER_VERSION=2.4.43
```

This will replace the following structure in `buildpack.yml`:
```yaml
httpd:
  # this allows you to specify a version constraint for the httpd dependency
  # any valid semver constraints (e.g. 2.* and 2.4.*) are also acceptable
  version: "2.4.43"
```
